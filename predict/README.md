# Predictor

This script allows to predict an option starting from a set of features. The subfolder ```predictor``` contains the classes that create the actual features.
The script has two modes: train and predict. The first one, trains a classifier using one of the options while the second one uses a given pre-trained classifier to output a prediction.
